Hello there. This is an unfinished project to generate code for the autonomous period within the framework of the FTC competition.
The project is under active development. The Flet framework, written in Python, was used as a basis.
You can download the .exe file in order to see the result.
You can also take part in the development, the installation instructions for the project will be written later. When working with a project, be sure to work in a NEW FEATURE/<feature_name> BRANCH. The changes will be canceled without a detailed description of the work done and features.
